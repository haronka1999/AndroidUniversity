# WhereToEat

The "WhereToEat" project is a simple application written in Kotlin for a University project.

## Description

The main goal of the application to work with restaurants
(data given by this link:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/94t6su4cimnrdnt/restaurants.json?dl=0 ) 
like adding to favorites, show on google map, filtering by City and sorting by name or price.

A side function of the app is that I used a local database with profile,

## Tools I used

3. Glide
5. Recycler View with CardView and adapter
6. Coroutines
